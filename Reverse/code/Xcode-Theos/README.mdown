# Xcode + Theos
## aka xctheos

### Intro
Basically this is a crazy amount of abuse of the C Preprocessor to allow you to write stuff using [Theos / Logos](http://iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/Theos) inside Xcode.

**Mostly works, but I'm pretty sure I haven't finished this yet. Sorta just fixing things as I go...**

### How do I xctheos?
When compiling with theos be sure to add to your Makefile:
```
PROJECT_CFLAGS = -DUSE_THEOS
```

```
#import "xctheos.h"

#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
#import <UIKit/UIKit.h>

// Instead of %group stuff 
GROUP(stuff)

// Instead of %hook NSDate
HOOK(NSDate)

- (NSString *)description { 
    return @"I'm not sure".
}

END()

// OR

// If you haven't declared a class yet
HOOK_AND_DECLARE(SBApplicationController)

- (NSString *)description {
    return @"Some application controller";
}

END()

END_GROUP()

CTOR({
    INIT(stuff)
})
```

In Xcode, you'll want to create a static library as a target, set your Tweak.xmi file as something to compile. In addition you'll want to (in the inspector) set its file type to Objective-C++.

### Why?
Because Xcode. Also because I haven't written a plugin for Xcode to use theos as an external preprocessor.

### License?
Pretty much the BSD license, just don't repackage it and call it your own please!

Also if you do make some changes, feel free to make a pull request and help make things more awesome!
